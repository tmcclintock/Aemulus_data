# Aemulus_data
A collection of all the data (excluding particle catalogs) used in Aemulus.

```building_box_cosmologies.txt``` contains the cosmological parameters used in the "building suite" of simulations. These are the simulations that the emulators are constructed from.

```test_box_cosmologies.txt``` contains the cosmological parameters sued in the "test suite" of simulations. These are used specifically to test the performance of the emulators.
